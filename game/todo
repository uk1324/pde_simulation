The interpolation should happen before the color mapping.

Add a modal with a reset button when the solver blows up.

Currently one of the slowest parts of the simulation code is checking wether a point is in a polygon. 
Here is an algorithm for making that faster

Also maybe because I check points on a grid consecutively this could be implemeted faster.
Maybe just some rendering algorithm could be used.
