The interpolation should happen before the color mapping.

Add a modal with a reset button when the solver blows up.

Currently one of the slowest parts of the simulation code is checking wether a point is in a polygon. 
Here is an algorithm for making that faster
https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/59917/repeated-point-in-polygon-preprocessing-complexity-given-logarithmic-query-time
Also maybe because I check points on a grid consecutively this could be implemeted faster.
Maybe just some rendering algorithm could be used.

What happens if the derivative at boundary is set to zero?

Velocity display.

If you visualize the absorbing boundary conditions with the velocity display then you can see the velocity reflecting.
Maybe calculate u directly instead of calculating u_t. Don't know if that will actually change anything.

The reflecting boundary conditions just simulate a zero speed of light on the side of the refleting material. I think not sure.

What is the most efficient way to triangulate a circle or in general a convex polygon. Does using the center as a vertex have advantages or is it better to use on vertex shared between all the other vertices.

How should undo redo of float input or any other text input be handled be handled
ideas
When a modification is found (compare state before gui and after gui) save the state. When the modification is finished then create an action.
One issue is what does when modification is finished mean.
If you just assume when the input is deactiated then things like this break.
Click the input
Start writing
press ctrl+z
No action will be saved, so it will revert the action done before clicking the input.
To handle this case I guess you could process the ctrl+z some way so it create an action and the the actual ctrl+z would undo it.

Could do something with combining actions if there are 2 consecutive actions that modify the same field.

Google search forgets the redo undo after you unfocus.

Serialization versioning.
Could put the number version on the whole file. Don't really see an advantage of putting in on smaller parts of the file as it is impossible to have parts of a file saved with different version numbers.
Because json is used adding a new field (with a default value) doesn't break backwards and forwards compatibility.
Removing a field would break backwards compatiblity (old versions can't load the new file), but doesn't break forwards compatiblity.
If there is some change that can't be handled this easily then make 2 versions of the struct with the breaking change and load based on version.
